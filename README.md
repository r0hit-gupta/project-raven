# Project Raven

### About
Raven is an intelligent traffic management system which uses computer vision and advanced machine learning models to detect vehicles and calculate traffic density at a traffic intersection. It uses a smart custom algorithm that helps control the traffic lights considering the traffic density at each intersection. The system actively learns about the traffic throughout the day and uses machine learning to accurately predict traffic density for any given time of the day.

### Features
* Intelligent Traffic Management using computer vision.
* A telegram bot to crowdsource and map accident prone areas.
* A smart fine payment module integrated.

### Installation
* Clone the project.
* Run `yarn install` to install the dependencies.
* Run `yarn start` to view the project in action.

### OpenCV Demo to Count Vehicles
* In "countingCars" directory, run 'python count.py' .
